# Voice-based-Dog-mood-prediction
Dog Mood Prediction uses deep learning to classify dog sounds (barking, whining, growling) into moods like happy, sad, or hungry. It processes real-time audio via ThingSpeak, analyzes it using TensorFlow and YAMNet, and sends mood notifications via email. Ideal for pet owners to understand their dog's emotions better.
